Form input for cards!

This is of course an increadibly fake version of writing in card details that will not be saved anywhere, but even so
add some fake names and numbers in as you try it out!

I recieved this challenge from frontend master, it looked really nice and I haven't worked much with forms
so I wanted to give it a try.

I also decided to try and build this using vanilla JS which I haven't done in a while, as I write most of my code
using React.

Enjoy putting in fake details!
